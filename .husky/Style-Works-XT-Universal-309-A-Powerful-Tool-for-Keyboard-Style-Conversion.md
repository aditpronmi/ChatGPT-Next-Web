# Style Works XT Universal 3.09: A Powerful Tool for Keyboard Style Conversion
 
If you are a keyboard player who owns two or more instruments from different manufacturers, you may have encountered the problem of incompatible styles. Styles are the accompaniment patterns that make your keyboard sound like a full band. Each keyboard brand has its own format and features for styles, which makes it hard to exchange them between different models.
