In this article, we will show you some of the features and benefits of IC3D Steel, and how it can help you with your next structural design project.
 
## What is IC3D Steel?
 
IC3D Steel is a software application developed by IC3D Pty Ltd, a leading innovative design technology provider for the manufacturing and construction sectors. It is based on SOLIDWORKS, a widely used CAD software for mechanical design and engineering. IC3D Steel extends the capabilities of SOLIDWORKS to enable you to model and detail steel structures with ease and accuracy.
 
IC3D Steel is compatible with any version of SOLIDWORKS from 2010 onwards, and it includes an SQL database that allows you to store and manage project information in a centralized and coherent way. You can access and share information across the network with other users, such as engineers, architects, fabricators, contractors, etc. You can also export and import data to and from other formats, such as DWG, DXF, IFC, PDF, etc.
 
## What are the features of IC3D Steel?
 
IC3D Steel offers a range of features that can help you with every stage of the structural design and detailing process. Some of the main features are:
 
- **Library of joints, tables and profiles**: IC3D Steel comes with a comprehensive library of predefined joints, tables and profiles that you can use to create your steel structures. You can also create your own custom joints, tables and profiles using the powerful Joint Builder tool. You can apply different types of connections, such as bolts, welds, pins, etc., and specify parameters such as size, spacing, orientation, etc.
- **Flexible member insertion**: IC3D Steel allows you to insert new steel members with one-click function. You can choose from different types of members, such as beams, columns, braces, plates, etc., and specify their properties, such as profile, material, length, angle, etc. You can also rotate, offset, align, copy and move members using intuitive commands.
- **Batch drawing creation**: IC3D Steel enables you to generate fabrication and assembly drawings automatically from your 3D model. You can choose from different drawing formats, such as views, plans, sections, perspectives, etc., and customize them according to your preferences. You can also add annotations, dimensions, labels, symbols, etc., to your drawings. IC3D Steel ensures that your drawings are always updated and linked to your model.
- **Rules based steel member numbering**: IC3D Steel helps you assign unique numbers to each steel member in your model using rules based on criteria such as type,
location,
orientation,
etc.
You can also edit,
sort,
and filter
the numbers
according
to your needs.
IC3D Steel
generates
a report
that lists
all the numbers
and their corresponding
members.
- **Virtual bolt feature**: IC3D Steel allows you to manage large quantities of fasteners,
such as bolts,
nuts,
washers,
etc.,
with the Virtual Bolt feature.
This feature
creates
a simplified representation
of the fasteners
in your model,
which reduces
the file size
and improves
the performance.
You can also generate
a Bolt List Report
that shows
the details
and quantities
of the fasteners
in your project.
- **Mode control**: IC3D Steel lets you switch between different modes of operation using the IC3D Steel Wheel. This tool allows you to control the level of detail,
the visibility,
and the selection
of the elements
in your model.
You can choose from four modes:
